# Starlog

Starlog is a participatory blog platform built with **Ruby on Rails (API-only)**, **PostgreSQL**, 
and **Vue 3 (Vite + Pinia + Vue Router)**.

The goal of this project is not only to create a modern and secure blog platform, 
but also to serve as a learning journey for practicing **Ruby on Rails** as a backend framework, 
focusing on building a clean and secure CRUD API, while integrating it with a Vue.js frontend.
